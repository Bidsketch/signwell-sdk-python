# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DocumentFromTemplateRequest from a JSON string
document_from_template_request_instance = DocumentFromTemplateRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DocumentFromTemplateRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
document_from_template_request_dict = document_from_template_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DocumentFromTemplateRequest from a dict
