# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DocumentRequest from a JSON string
document_request_instance = DocumentRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DocumentRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
document_request_dict = document_request_instance.to_dict()
